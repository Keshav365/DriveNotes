# 🚀 File Upload Functionality - Testing Guide

## ✅ What I Fixed

The file upload functionality wasn't working because:
1. **Missing multer middleware** - Added for handling file uploads
2. **No file storage** - Added local file storage with serving capability  
3. **Missing upload routes** - Created complete file management API
4. **Frontend had no upload component** - Built drag & drop file upload UI
5. **Dashboard wasn't connected** - Integrated everything together

## 🎯 How to Test File Upload

### Step 1: Start Enhanced Server
```powershell
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Start the enhanced server with file upload support
cd server
node enhanced-server.js
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Starting DriveNotes Server with File Upload...
📁 Created uploads directory
📡 Connecting to MongoDB...
✅ Connected to MongoDB
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:5000
📁 File uploads: C:\Users\ShivamG\Documents\DrivenShit\server\uploads
✨ Ready to accept requests with FILE UPLOAD support!
```

### Step 2: Start Frontend (if not running)
```powershell
# In another terminal
cd client
npm run dev
```
