# 🎉 Authentication Fixed - Test Instructions

## ✅ What I Fixed

The sign in/register buttons were not working because:
1. **Missing authentication pages** - Created login and register pages
2. **Missing API service** - Created API service to communicate with backend
3. **Missing authentication context** - Added React context for user state management
4. **Static buttons** - Updated all buttons to have proper navigation and functionality

## 🚀 How to Test Your Working App

### Step 1: Start the Backend Server
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Start the API server
cd server
node simple-server.js
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Starting DriveNotes Server...
📡 Connecting to MongoDB...
✅ Connected to MongoDB
🚀 Server running on http://localhost:5000
✨ Ready to accept requests!
```

### Step 2: Start the Frontend
```powershell
# Terminal 2 - Start the frontend
cd client
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
▲ Next.js 14.0.3
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
```
